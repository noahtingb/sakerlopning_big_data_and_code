With runing newfile.py you compare the code in noahtingb7 to https://github.com/biglimp/PETCalculatorWEB for PET and Tmrt for at least a random time for a prognose in a 2 week spann between 2 April to 15 April 2025 for each of 322 random places in the world and Gothenburg.
The prints are the Tmrt of each of the place and time for the different code and at the end it print the variance between them for Tmrt and PET.
